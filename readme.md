### Installing

`python -m venv venv`
`venv/Scripts/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

if you want to add a new package please include it in the requirements.txt.

### Contributing
- make sure to create commands like the ones already present in `commands/{command}.py`, (the logic should be present in `./util/views.py`) if you want them to include a profile selector, otherwise feel free to do whatever.

### Emojis
